CookCraft is built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture and integrates with the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) for recipe data and the [Daily Calorie Intake Calculator](https://www.calories.info/calorie-intake-calculator) to provide accurate, personalized meal plans.

The main inspiration for this project came after completing [The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert! by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
